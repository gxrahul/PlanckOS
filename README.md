PlanckOS
=====================

A simple OS written in assembly for X86 real mode.
I wrote this just to have some understanding of how things work at low level.
This was written just after my graduation, when I was looking for job. This is still one of my most fun project.
It has -
1. simple round robin scheduling and memory management
2. A simple File system
3. A basic shell
